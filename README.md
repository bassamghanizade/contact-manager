# Contact Manager (Python)

A simple command-line Contact Manager built with Python.

This project allows users to manage contacts using a persistent JSON file for storage.

## Features

- Add new contacts
- View all contacts
- Search for a contact
- Update contact information
- Delete contacts
- Persistent data storage using JSON
- Interactive main loop (CLI menu)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- JSON file handling
- Basic CRUD operations
- File I/O

## How It Works

The program runs in a loop and displays a menu with different options.
User input determines which action is performed.

All contacts are stored in a JSON file, allowing the data to persist between runs.

2. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/bassamghanizade/Contact-manager.git
3. Navigate to the project folder: cd contact-manager
4. Run: python contact-manager.py

## Learning Goals

- Structuring a Python program
- Working with functions
- Managing state
- Handling files
- Writing clean and modular code
